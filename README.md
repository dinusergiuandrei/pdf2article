# DocAnnotator
## Description
Input: a file in .pdf format. Output: the articles from the given pdf, with metadata (text metadata, title, authors)

## Training data
Because the size of the training data is over 2 GB, it will not be uploaded to repo, so you have to manually copy the training data to *training_data* folder. In order to avoid uploading by mistake the training data, the folder *training_data* is present in *.gitignore* file.
